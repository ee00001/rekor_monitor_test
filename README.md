# Rekor Log Monitor

Rekor Log Monitor provides an easy-to-use monitor to verify log consistency,
that the log is immutability and append-only. Monitoring is critical to
the transparency log ecosystem, as logs are tamper-evident but not tamper-proof.

To run, simply fork this repository, and you'll begin to monitor Rekor.
